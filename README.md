A Sane DataMapper for PHP
=======

Redub aims to be a simple and extensible datamapper for PHP.  Although there are a number of ORMs
available, including those which use the data mapper pattern, they all present significant issues
for rapid development.

## Goals

- Simple API
- Limited Magic
- Faster Development

## Documentation

- [Database Abstraction Layer](./docs/dbal/Introduction.md)
- [Object Relational Mapper](./docs/orm/Introduction.md)
