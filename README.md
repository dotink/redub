A Sane DataMapper for PHP
=======

Redub aims to be a simple and extensible datamapper for PHP.  Although there are a number of ORMs
available, including those which use the data mapper pattern, they all present significant issues
for rapid development.

## Goals

- Simple API
- Limited Magic
- Faster Development

## Documentation

Please check [the Wiki](https://github.com/dotink/Redub/wiki) for the time being.
